### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm Aakash — a passionate IT student currently in my 7th semester. I'm diving deep into **React Native and the MERN Stack** while actively participating in **hackathons, competitions, and community tech events**.  
As a **short-tempered yet determined techie**, I believe in pushing limits, whether it's code, design, or ideas.

🔭 Currently Building:  
- A **React Native 100-Day Challenge** documented on Instagram and TikTok.  
- Projects focused on **social impact**, including **food donation systems**, **travel safety apps**, and **waste management platforms**.

🎯 My Goal:  
To become a **top-tier mobile app developer** and contribute to impactful projects while growing through real-world learning and team collaboration.
